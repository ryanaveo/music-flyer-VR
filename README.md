## Description
A web app that uses the Spotify API to generate a flyer of a given artist. The flyer includes the artist's picture, highlights their top tracks by embedding a Spotify playlist, provides links to their social media, and transports user to related artists. 

On the front-end, we used HTML5/CSS3 and Javascript. We learned the importance of libraries such as jQuery and Bootstrap which optimized our development time by making processes like page layout easier. 

On the back-end, we used Flask to handle URL routing, rendering, and injecting variables into the html file for the different artists.
